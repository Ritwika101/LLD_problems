This is the object oriented solution of a parking lot with multiple floors, and multiple spots. Keeping it simple, 3 vehicle types can be present - bike, car, truck, and 3 spots can be assigned respectively to them - motorcycle, compact, large.
<br> Ideally while calculation of the ending time, that is the time of the exit of the vehicle, the current time should be fetched, but since this code executes very quickly, I have take an hour difference of 5 for every exit.
<br> The main function has the implmentation of one of the possible flows of the system.
<br> Used design patterns :
  <li>Factory pattern</li>
  <li>Singleton</li>
